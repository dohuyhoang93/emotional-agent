name: "Agent Dream Loop"
description: "Workflow for Internal Simulation (Dreaming) without external sensory input"

steps:
  # 1. Inject Dream Stimulus (Noise/Replay)
  - process_inject_dream_stimulus
  
  # 2. SNN Core Cycle (Atomic Steps) with Safety
  - process_hysteria_dampener      # Safety Brake (Homeostasis)
  - process_integrate
  - process_lateral_inhibition     # Local inhibition
  - process_fire
  
  # 3. Learning & Consolidation
  - process_dream_coherence_reward # Generate internal reward signal
  - process_stdp_3factor           # Learning (uses coherence reward)
  
  # 4. Visualization/Analysis
  - process_decode_dream
