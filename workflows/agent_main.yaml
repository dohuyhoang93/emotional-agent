description: "Agent loop với SNN processing và intermediate rewards (16-dim sensor system)"

steps:
  # Perception (updated với sensor system)
  - perception
  
  # SNN Processing Pipeline
  - process_hysteria_dampener    # [Safety] Prevent runaway excitation
  - encode_state_to_spikes      # State → SNN spikes
  - process_integrate            # LIF integrate
  - process_lateral_inhibition   # [Focus] WTA / Sparse Coding
  - process_fire                 # LIF fire
  - process_clustering           # Cluster analysis
  - process_stdp_3factor         # 3-Factor R-STDP (Reward Modulated)
  - process_commitment           # Synaptic Commitment (Phase 7)
  - process_neural_darwinism     # Evolutionary Selection (Phase 11)
  - encode_emotion_vector        # SNN → emotion vector
  
  # RL Decision Making
  - compute_intrinsic_reward_snn # Novelty-based reward
  - combine_rewards              # Extrinsic + intrinsic
  - select_action_gated          # Emotion-gated action
  
  - process_inject_viral_with_quarantine # Filter blacklisted sources (Sandbox Entrance)
  - process_quarantine_validation # Validate viral synapses (Sandbox Exit)
  - process_meta_homeostasis_fixed # Advanced stability
  - process_resync               # Maintenance
  
  # Execution & Learning
  - execute_action
  - record_consequences
  - update_q_learning
  
  # Social Learning is handled by MultiAgentExperiment (Orchestrator level)
