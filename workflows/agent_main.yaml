name: "RL-SNN Agent Loop"
description: "Agent loop với SNN processing và intermediate rewards (16-dim sensor system)"

steps:
  # Perception (updated với sensor system)
  - perception
  
  # SNN Processing Pipeline
  # SNN Processing Pipeline (Composite Optimization)
  - process_snn_cycle

  # Advanced Features (Post-Cycle)
  - process_commitment
  - process_neural_darwinism
  - process_assimilate_ancestor
  
  # RL Decision Making
  - compute_intrinsic_reward_snn # Novelty-based reward
  - combine_rewards              # Extrinsic + intrinsic
  - select_action_gated          # Emotion-gated action
  
  - process_inject_viral_with_quarantine # Filter blacklisted sources (Sandbox Entrance)
  - process_quarantine_validation # Validate viral synapses (Sandbox Exit)
  - process_meta_homeostasis_fixed # Advanced stability
  - process_resync               # Maintenance
  
  # Execution & Learning
  - execute_action
  - record_consequences
  - update_q_learning
  
  # Social Learning is handled by MultiAgentExperiment (Orchestrator level)
